                        <p>Garry Winogrand (14 January 1928 – 19 March 1984) was an American street photographer
                        from the Bronx, New York, known for his portrayal of U.S. life and its social issues, in
                        the mid-20th century. Though he photographed in California, Texas and elsewhere, Winogrand
                        was essentially a New York photographer.
                        He received three Guggenheim Fellowships to work on personal projects, a fellowship from the
                        National Endowment for the Arts,[1] and published four books during his lifetime. He was one
                        of three photographers featured in the influential New Documents exhibition at Museum of Modern

                        Art in New York in 1967 and had solo exhibitions there in 1969, 1977, and 1988. He supported
                        himself by working as a freelance photojournalist and advertising photographer in the 1950s and

                        1960s, and taught photography in the 1970s. His photographs featured in photography magazines
                        including Popular Photography, Eros, Contemporary Photographer, and Photography Annual.
                        Photography curator, historian, and critic John Szarkowski called Winogrand the central photographer
                        of his generation. Critic Sean O'Hagan, writing in The Guardian in 2014, said "In the 1960s
                        and 70s, he defined street photography as an attitude as well as a style – and it has laboured in
                        his shadow ever since, so definitive are his photographs of New York." Phil Coomes, writing for

                        BBC News in 2013, said "For those of us interested in street photography there are a few names that
                        stand out and one of those is Garry Winogrand, whose pictures of New York in the 1960s are a
                        photographic lesson in every frame."
                        At the time of his death Winogrand's late work remained undeveloped, with about 2,500 rolls of
                        undeveloped film, 6,500 rolls of developed but not proofed exposures, and about 3,000 rolls only
                        realized as far as contact sheets being made.</p>
